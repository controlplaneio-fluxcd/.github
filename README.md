## Welcome to ControlPlane Enterprise for Flux CD ⚡☸️

[ControlPlane](https://control-plane.io/) offers a hardened, enterprise-grade distribution and
support services for the CNCF-graduated [Flux project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/flux/).

### Enterprise Distribution

The ControlPlane distribution comes with enterprise-hardened container images for the
Flux [GitOps Toolkit controllers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/) including:

- Hardened container images and SBOMs in-sync with upstream Flux releases.
- Continuous scanning and CVE patching for Flux controller images.
- SLAs for remediation of critical vulnerabilities affecting Flux functionality.
- FIPS-compliant Flux builds based on FIPS 140-2 validated BoringSSL.
- Extended compatibility of Flux controllers for the latest six minor releases of Kubernetes.
- Assured compatibility with Kubernetes LTS versions provided by cloud vendors such as Azure, AWS, Google and others.

> [!TIP]
> ControlPlane offers a seamless transition between CNCF Flux to the enterprise distribution with no impact
> to Flux availability. The hardened container images provided by ControlPlane are fully compatible
> with the upstream Flux bootstrap procedure and can be employed with a simple patch to the Flux deploy manifests.
